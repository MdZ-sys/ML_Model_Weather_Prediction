# ML_Model_Weather_Prediction
Different works related to prediction of air quality index (AQI) done by previous researchers and based on the knowledge gained, to use different machine learning techniques to build predictive models for air quality index. Critical evaluation of the models built and to suggest the best model among them. 

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE 
•	To conduct literature review of works done related to the domain and problem of predicting air quality index (AQI).
•	To build different machine learning models to predict AQI.
•	To perform critical evaluation of the models built by comparison.
